This forever-while loop *is* the program's main (and only) thread. It runs in an interrupted fashion to allow concurrency. We get the pereception of conucrrent actions because in process simulation, only the start and finish of an operation are of material consequence and the program can execute tasks queued in the event loop in the interval. Thus, the forever-while loop in the 1st generator function directs the script.\n",

As process complexity increases and it has multiple steps, possibly sharing resources, with outages and other scenarios baked in the process characterization, we need to organize code better. We do this with Object Oriented Programming (OOP) where we divide responsibilities among classes. A class bundles data and methods into a package with logically coherent behavior. "
