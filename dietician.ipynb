Doing so means we have access to the entire contents at once, whereas a generator only gives the next item upon request. But list is less efficient because entire contents are loaded into memory whereas we may only want to work with one item from the list at a time. Rewrite the plotting function with the generator. "

As process complexity increases and it has multiple steps, possibly sharing resources, with outages and other scenarios baked in the process characterization, we need to organize code better. We do this with Object Oriented Programming (OOP) where we divide responsibilities among classes. A class bundles data and methods into a package with logically coherent behavior. "
